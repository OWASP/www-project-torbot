## Working Procedure/Basic Plan
The basic procedure executed by the web crawling algorithm takes a list of seed URLs as its input and repeatedly executes
the following steps:
<code>
 <pre>
URLs = input(url)
while(URLs is not empty) do
    dequeue url
    request page
    parse for Links
    for(link in Links) do 
        if (link islive && link is not visited) then 
            add link to URLs
    store page content
 </pre>
 </code>

## Contribute
Contributions to this project are always welcome.
To add a new feature fork the dev branch and give a pull request when your new feature is tested and complete.
If its a new module, it should be put inside the modules directory.
The branch name should be your new feature name in the format <Feature_featurename_version(optional)>. For example, <i>Feature_FasterCrawl_1.0</i>.
Contributor name will be updated to the below list. 😀

<b> NOTE : The PR should be made only to `dev` branch of TorBot. </b>

### OS Dependencies
- Tor
- Python 3.x
- Golang 1.x (Not Currently Used)

### Python Dependencies
- beautifulsoup4
- pyinstaller
- PySocks
- termcolor
- requests
- requests_mock
- yattag


## Basic setup
Before you run the torBot make sure the following things are done properly:

* Run tor service
`sudo service tor start`

* Make sure that your torrc is configured to SOCKS_PORT localhost:9050

* Install TorBot Python requirements
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

On Linux platforms, you can make an executable for TorBot by using the install.sh script.
You will need to give the script the correct permissions using `chmod +x install.sh`
Now you can run `./install.sh` to create the torBot binary.
Run `./torBot` to execute the program. 

An alternative way of running torBot is shown below, along with help instructions.

`python3 torBot.py or use the -h/--help argument`
<pre>
usage: torBot.py [-h] [-v] [--update] [-q] [-u URL] [-s] [-m] [-e EXTENSION]
                 [-l] [-i]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Show current version of TorBot.
  --update              Update TorBot to the latest stable version
  -q, --quiet           Prevent header from displaying
  -u URL, --url URL     Specifiy a website link to crawl, currently returns links on that page
  -s, --save            Save results to a file in json format
  -m, --mail            Get e-mail addresses from the crawled sites
  -e EXTENSION, --extension EXTENSION
                        Specifiy additional website extensions to the
                        list(.com or .org etc)
  -l, --live            Check if websites are live or not (slow)
  -i, --info            Info displays basic info of the scanned site (very
                        slow)` </pre>

* NOTE: All flags under -u URL, --url URL must also be passed a -u flag.

#### Using the GUI 


#### Using Docker

- Ensure than you have a tor container running on port 9050.
- Build the image using following command:
    
    `docker build -t dedsecinside/torbot .`
- Run the container (make sure to link the tor container as `tor`):
    
    `docker run --link tor:tor --rm -ti dedsecinside/torbot`


### Have ideas?
If you have new ideas which is worth implementing, mention those by starting a new issue with the title [FEATURE_REQUEST].
If the idea is worth implementing, congratz, you are now a contributor.

    abstract="The dark web has turned into a dominant source of illegal activities. With several volunteered networks, it is      becoming more difficult to track down these services. Open source intelligence (OSINT) is a technique used to gather intelligence on targets by harvesting publicly available data. Performing OSINT on the Tor network makes it a challenge for both researchers and developers because of the complexity and anonymity of the network. This paper presents a tool which shows OSINT in the dark web. With the use of this tool, researchers and Law Enforcement Agencies can automate their task of crawling and identifying different services in the Tor network. This tool has several features which can help extract different intelligence.",
